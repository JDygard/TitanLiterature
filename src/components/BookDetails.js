       Van is about to leave home on the journey of his lifetime. The pilgrimage marks a Nemian's coming of age
       and Van's been preparing for it since the day he was born, but he's about to learn the world is a much bigger 
       place than he was raised to believe-- and nothing could prepare him to face off against cosmic horrors from other worlds and the inconvenience of adolescent love, 
       which sometimes go hand in hand.
